The purpose of this repository is to allow someone to know the public IP (also called external IP) of their network. I created this script to assist me with remotely communicating with devices on my home network.
The intended use of this repository is in conjuction with a task schedule, such as Windows Task Scheduler, or perhaps a custom task scheduling system, that can periodically run the main.py script from a networked 
computer, such as a home server.
